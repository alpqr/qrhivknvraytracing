Demo of using VK_NV_raytracing in a (Vulkan-only) QRhi application.

Needs an RTX card, a recent Vulkan SDK, and a patched (https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/291562) qtbase 5.15.

It uses QRhi's facilities as much as possible, in order to reduce the native Vulkan boilerplate needed,
so this also a good test of accessing the native objects backing a QRhiBuffer or QRhiTexture.
