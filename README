Demo of using VK_NV_raytracing in a (Vulkan-only) QRhi application.

Needs an RTX card, a recent Vulkan SDK, and a patched (*) qtbase 5.15.

The result is a wonderful triangle.

It uses QRhi's facilities as much as possible, in order to reduce the native Vulkan boilerplate needed, so this also a
good test of accessing the native objects backing a QRhiBuffer or QRhiTexture.

The raytracing shaders and much of the pipeline setup are based on the sample at https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/tree/master/examples/nv_ray_tracing_basic
